Princeton Ansible Playbooks
===========================

# Developing

You can use a vagrant machine to develop and test these ansible playbooks. In
order to do so, run `vagrant up` from this directory.

After the box is built, you can re-run the scripts via `vagrant provision`.

You can ignore the prompt for an SSH password, but will have to put in the
Ansible Vault password.
